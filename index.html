            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.</li>
            <li>Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</li>
            <li>Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript  and java</h2>
        <article>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.</p>
            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.</p>
            <p>JavaScript code used to run only in the browser, but now it can run on the server via Node.js. while Java applications can run in any virtual machine(JVM) or browser. </p>

        <h2>Hello world</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                To get started with writing javaScript, open the Scratched and write your first "Hello World" javaScript:
            </p>
            <code>
                Function greetMe(yourName){ alert("Hello "+ yourName);}greetMe("World");
            </code>


            select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold browser!

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
            <p>JavaScript Variables are the building blocks of any programming language. In JavaScript, variables can be used to store reusable values. The values of the variables are allocated using the assignment operator(“=”).</p>
            <p>JavaScript variables must have unique names. These names are called Identifiers or variables.</p>
            <p>These are case-sensitive. It Can only begin with a letter, underscore(“_”) or “$” symbol</p>
            <p>It can contain letters, numbers, underscore, or “$” symbol. A variable name cannot be a reserved keyword.</p>
